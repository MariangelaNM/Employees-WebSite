# Employees-WebSite

## Project Introduction

Welcome to the Employees-WebSite Frontend repository! This GitHub project is dedicated to the development of the user interface for Employees-Api using C# and ASP.NET MVC.

## Project Highlights

### ASP.NET MVC Architecture

This project follows the ASP.NET MVC architecture, providing a structured and modular approach to building scalable web applications. The separation of concerns allows for efficient development and maintenance of both the backend and frontend components.
